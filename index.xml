      <description>Our mentors are the most amazing mentors EVER!!!
They exemplify kindness, leadership, and encourage us to approach problems in new, creative ways. Without them, we simply would not have a team. So, a big shoutout to our Mother and Father, Rick and Lisa, as well as our brother Parker, for their unending support and tolerance of our travels with robotics.
NOTE: Rick and Lisa did in fact earn the Mentor of the Year Award at the Northern New York State Championship!</description>

      <description>/** @file API.h * @brief Provides the high-level user functionality intended for use by typical * VEX Cortex * programmers. * * This file should be included for you in the predefined stubs in each new VEX * Cortex PROS * project through the inclusion of &amp;quot;main.h&amp;quot;. In any new C source file, it is * advisable to * include main.h instead of referencing API.h by name, to better handle any * nomenclature * changes to this file or its contents.</description>

      <description>/** @file main.h * @brief Header file for global functions * * Any experienced C or C++ programmer knows the importance of header files. For *those who * do not, a header file allows multiple files to reference functions in other *files without * necessarily having to see the code (and therefore causing a multiple *definition). To make * a function in &amp;quot;opcontrol.c&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;auto.c&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;main.c&amp;quot;, or any other C file visible *to the core * implementation files, prototype it here.</description>
